## UX Design

### Strategy
The aim of the project is to promote the band by making users aware of their history, marketing their merchandise, creating awareness of thier upcoming gigs and allowing users to send booking enquiries for their own events. 

These elements will assist the band in securing more gigs and selling more merchandise and tickets. They are also for fans to access information about the band, buy merchandise and tickets as well as book them for personal events. 

### Scope
The project will include four linked pages:
1. Homepage - This will include a brief introduction, a carousel of images, band member information, a video and a calendar of upcoming gigs (with links to ticket sites)
2. Biography page - A more in-depth look into the band's history with more photographs. 
3. Merchandise page - This will include three navigable sections (Records/CDs, T-Shirts and Books). Each item will have an external link for 'purchase'. 
4. Booking Enquiry page - This page will include a form through which the user can send a booking enquiry to the band along with a message. 
The user will be asked for their title, first and last name, email and phone number. Sending a fully-filled form will lead the user to a success message, which will provide a link back to the homepage. 

Each page will include a footer with contact information (address, email and phone number) as well as social media links (as icons). 

The homepage, biography page and merchandise page will also include a button link to the enquiry page to book the band for events. 

### Structure
(See Wireframes section below)

### Skeleton

The user will navigate between the pages by clicking the links in the navbar menu (visible in tablet view and on desktop, collapsed on mobile devices).
The active page will be highlighted in the navbar. 

Clicking the select menu on the merchandise page (in tablet and desktop view) will take the user to the specific merchandise section. 

### Surface
To match the aesthetic and sound of the band, the website's colourscheme will match this contrast and  will contain 'Sushi' #96ad3c and 'Night Rider' #120808 background colours with contrasting footer sections. 

The smaller text of the site will be 'Night Rider' #120808 or Chartruse Yellow' #e5ff00 against the contrasting backgrounds to allow for readability. Large text highlights will be in 'Purple Pizzazz' #ff00d5
